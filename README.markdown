#Airports App
##Description
Airports app from Code Academy class. The Flights show page uses the Google Maps to Rails GEM (Gmaps4Rails). 
##Notes
To figure out the polylines I needed to manually create a JSON array of Latitude and Longitude attributes from the Airports model and then map those into "lat" and "lng" JSON keys. If you find ways to re-factor this code please fork or let me know. Thanks.
